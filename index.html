                    <p>Thank you for visiting my page. I’m a junior full stack develop attending UCF Coding bootcamp. We work with current technologies in  a challenging environment on the daily. When not at school you might find me playing tennis, running or spending time with family here in the sunshine state. I have two fur babies that are certified professional level coding support.</p>

                    <p>My educational background includes a B.S. in Health Services Administration from University of Central Florida and a Masters of Science in Physical Therapy from University of Florida. I bring clinical management, physical therapy and business ownership experience joined with technology. Please reach out if a developer with health care experience is an asset for your company, however it will be my pleasure to support your endeavor in an industry.
                     </p>
                    
                    <p>We are constantly collaborating with educators, industry leaders and other students to stay on the edge of current technologies. Please check back often to see current and future development projects on my page. I’ll be striving to bring you best junior developer code EVER! </p>
