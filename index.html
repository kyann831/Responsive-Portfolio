      <p>Thank you for visiting my page. I’m a junior full stack develop attending UCF Coding bootcamp. We work with current technologies in a challenging environment daily. When not at school you might find me playing tennis, running or spending time with family here in the sunshine state. I have two fur babies that are certified professional level coding support. </p>

I bring clinical management, physical therapy and business ownership experience joined with technology. </p>

      <p>Please reach out if a developer with health care experience is an asset for your company, however it will be my pleasure to support your endeavor in an industry. We are constantly collaborating with educators, industry leaders and other students to stay on the edge of current technologies.
